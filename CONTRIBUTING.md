## Setting up your development environment

### Prerequisites
- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Install the VS Code extensions recommended by this workspace:
    - [dbaeumer.vscode-eslint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
    - [connor4312.esbuild-problem-matchers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=connor4312.esbuild-problem-matchers)

### Setup
- Clone this repository
- Run the command `npm install` in the root directory of the repository
- Open the _"vscode-unreal-python.code-workspace"_ workspace in VS Code

### Debugging the extension
- Once the workspace is open, press <kbd>F5</kbd> to start debugging the extension.
    The extension will be launched in a new VS Code window. You should now be able to set breakpoints, see logs, etc.
- After making a change to the source code you must reload the extension, by e.g. running "Developer: Reload Window" from the command palette in the window running the extension.
