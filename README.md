# Unreal Engine Python (Visual Studio Code)

Editor features to assist when writing Python code for Unreal Engine.

<br>

## Features

### Execute Code

Run code in Unreal Engine directly from within the editor:

Command: `Unreal Python: Execute` <br>
Keyboard Shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Enter</kbd>

The selected text will be executed, or if nothing is selected the entire document will be executed.

<br>

### Setup Code Completion

Command: `Unreal Python: Setup code completion`

<br>

### Debugging
Attach VS Code to Unreal Engine to debug your scripts, set breakpoints and step through the code.

Command: `Unreal Python: Attach`

<br>


### Documentation
Browse the python documentation inside VS Code. This documentation is generated from your current engine, so it will always be the correct version & also include your own custom C++ functions/classes.

Command: `Unreal Python: Open Documentation`

<br>

#### Note:
Commands can be run from VS Code's command palette, `Show All Commands` _(Default shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>P</kbd>)_
